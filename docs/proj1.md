# Project 1

## How to Pick  a Project

(Hint: do it now!)

Pick something:

- Cool: 
    - Cause you have to impress;
- Ambitious:
    -  Cause you are here to make mistakes
- Not too ambitious:
    - So you cannot make significant progress in 5 weeks;
- Not too small: 
    - So you can  impress people with the work;
- Small enough:
    - So you can finish;
- Where there is something already running:
    - So you get going fast;
- In a language that everyone in the team can handle:
    - So everyone can participate

## Deliverable check list

score each 0..4 (0=none, 2=ok, 4=Wow). Sum, divide by number of rows, multiple by 10.
