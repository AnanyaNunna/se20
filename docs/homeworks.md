# project

take my se 4 ai paper. look at the 7 categories. try to find a project in one of those cats. or got for cat8: anything at all

look at the ethros stuff. sonsir some poullar eice of software, eg, sqllite or sckitlearn. ask about ethics.

sho them http://mcis.polymtl.ca/publications/2018/msr2.pdf afterwards. or the model store stuff

# homework ideas

1. read the ethics docs. list definitions and overlaps between the ethical wods. propose changes to sqlite or skikit learn to make it more.ess ethical
2. make a good github repo

1. github. get travis going. do x=x+1
2. write a command line parser. have sperate objects for each command line. arg. long name, short name, helo test
   expected number of argumets, defaults, teets. everyyone work serperate, write sperately one class per argument 
    (evertone writes their own). one person has to write the emta methods
     - run over the objects, print help text (-h)
     - run over  the args, match them to objects.
3. gind some code oc condct, coding sandard isnspect work. review each others code. fix each others code. do pull requests.
